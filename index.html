    <h1>Introduction.</h1>
    <p>The book “BORN A CRIME” is written by a South African young man. In his book he expresses his knowledge on politics,Apatheid regime,family affairs and also allows us to  know him from his childhood days till when he matures to become a youth. He does not hold back any mischief he ever did as a child,but uses these flaws to reveal a side of him which is comical. It is through these mischiefs that the book becomes more and more interesting to read.

    <p>In this chapter Trevor expresses his untimely and yet “illegal” birth. He later on tells us of how hard it was being who he was, that is, mixed. Just like the author my birth was also not timely because my mother and father were still dating when I was conceived. Then it happened that my dad was from a rich family while my mum was not. This made it even worse since they couldn't get married. A year after my birth my dad passed away my mother had no choice but to introduce herself to my dad’s parents. Just as expected they rejected both my mum and I.

    <h3>Trevor pray.</h3>

    <p>The author starts the chapter by making it known that he grew up in a world led by women. Just like him I also had the same experience. I have grown knowing and feeling that my mother has everything under control. Just like Patricia,my mother showed me all the love I could ever need as a child. I also grew up having a very strong religious background. Every sunday it was a norm for us to attend church.I attended sunday school while my mum attended main service. Whether it rained “Cats and dogs” it was  written in stone tablets!. Praying was also a necessity in my mums house, just like Trevor I would be asked to pray for our needs since my mum always had this belief that childrens prayers are the best.
   </p>
   <p>Just like Trevors house,we also had our toilet outside. There was nothing annoying in the world like the state of that toilet.All our neighbors used it and so hygiene was very hard to maintain. I cannot count the number of times I prefered helping myself in the bush rather than inhale the disgusting smell that toilet had. I would also,once or twice, lay a newspaper on the floor and get straight to it. It happened one day that I was mad and so I decided to do the usual. Just as I was about to finish, my mother and one of her friends walked right in.I could see my mum's face covered in embarrassment.Since the visitor couldn't stay,she left. I will never forget the kind of beating I received.
   </p>
   <h3>Human adaptation.</h3>
   <p>In this chapter,Trevor starts by telling a story of how he played “doctor”.This definitely did not end well. One cold but chilly afternoon,my cousins and I also decided to play “doctor” and “patient”. Just being a kid and innocent like I was,I saw no harm in pushing a bean inside my cousin's nose.Further more I was supposed to get it out like the “doctor” I was. Everything went from bright to dark whe the bean stuck and blood started flowing out of the nose.Not knowing what to do,we all started crying in unison.Thats when our neighbors heard and came rushing. Luckily enough the doctors removed the bean and immediately the bleeding stoped.My mum was filled with so much fury when she came back  from work. From  that day henceforth I was to sleep if I had nothing constructive to do. 
   </p>
   <p>Even though Trevor was zulu,that's not the only language he spoke.Knowing the error they were livng,Patrica being the clever woman she was, taught Trevor other languages.This became a tool he used to camouflage him wherever he went.It made it easy for him as an outsider becoming  an insder.He escaped so many dangerous instances which would either leave him dead or all bruised up.Him speakng other languages saved him from being racist like all the other people around him. He grew up not havng the mentality that people are different or looked different.He related freely with everyone;hindi,colored and white.</p>
   <h3>The love of a mother.</h3>

    <p>Though Patricia wasn't earning so much money,she always did her best to provide Trevor with everything he wanted.When Trevor asked for Adidas shoes his mother went ahead and bought him second-hand fake shoes.Trevor pointed out the issue but his mother made a joke about it saying “I see no difference,you're lucky you got an extra strip.” She did not care about the originality or fakeness of the shoe but the fact that she was able to provide Trevor with what he wanted.
    </p>
    <h3>"Breaking the rules."</h3>

    <p>Trevor attended a Catholic school  which had so many damn rules which neither Trevor nor his mother agreed with. One of the rules was that non-Catholics are not to partake in the holy eucharist.I loved how Trevor justified the fact that Jesus was not catholic but Jewish but still had the right to take holy communion.This incidence goes to show how our churches and church leaders have become hypocritical to the extent of having rules that only benefit a set of given people rather than all people,whether from different or same dominions.Trevor decided to eat all of Jesus body and blood and was unapologetic about it.The school  principal gave him a way out and he took it.
    </p>
    <h1>Take aways.</h1>
    <p>The book gives one  motivation to be themselves and do what is right  whenever faced with  challenges .Just like Trevor I will always strive to re-define the odds stay true to myself and break away from  cultures that hold me back and always hinders me from exploiting my full potential.Life has a lot to offer but also has so many challenges it throws our way.
